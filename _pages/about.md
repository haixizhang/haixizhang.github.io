Hello! I'm **Haixi Zhang**, a Software Engineer specializing in **autonomous systems and robotics applications**. I hold a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester and an M.Eng. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Cornell University

I develop **machine learning and computer vision algorithms** for perception, tracking, and planning tasks using multi-modal sensor data. My expertise spans from low-level embedded systems programming to high-level AI model development, with a particular focus on making autonomous systems safer and more reliable.

**Core Areas of Expertise:**
- **Autonomous Systems**: State estimation, multi-object tracking, SLAM, and planning algorithms
- **Computer Vision**: Real-time perception pipelines, object detection, depth estimation, and sensor fusion
- **Robotics**: ROS-based systems, embedded firmware development, and hardware integration
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, time series forecasting, and multi-modal learning

I'm proficient in **C++, Python, and MATLAB** with extensive experience in **PyTorch, ROS, and embedded systems**. My background spans from debugging hardware with oscilloscopes to deploying ML models in production environments. I believe in writing **robust, well-tested software** that can handle real-world uncertainties.

I'm passionate about advancing robotics and autonomy to improve the human experience through scalable, safe deployment solutions. Whether it's developing state-of-the-art perception algorithms or integrating complex sensor systems, I enjoy tackling challenges that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical applications.

When I'm not immersed in code or research, I'm fascinated by world history, particularly the Renaissance period through the Second Industrial Revolution. There's something captivating about how technological and social innovations from those eras laid the groundwork for today's advancements. I'm also a big fan of **Yes, Prime Minister** â€“ the wit and political satire never get old!
