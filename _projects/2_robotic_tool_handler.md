## Project Overview
Lead developer for a robotic tool handling system as part of senior design capstone project at University of Rochester.

## Technical Implementation
- **Platform**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano (ARM Cortex-based)
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu Linux with ROS
- **Languages**: C, C++, Python
- **Development**: GitLab CI/CD pipeline

## Key Achievements
- Designed and integrated embedded firmware in C & Python on the ARM Cortex-based NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform
- Leveraged Ubuntu Linux and ROS for real-time motion control and sensor data acquisition
- Developed test-driven modules and SIL/HIL testing to ensure robot arm movements under strict latency requirements
- Implemented YOLO-based object detection and path planning with 20% increased throughput
- Integrated with GitLab CI/CD for seamless build/test workflows
- Debugged communication signals using oscilloscopes and logic analyzers
- Tuned clocks and interrupts to fix timing issues

## Technologies Used
- **Embedded Systems**: RTOS, ARM Cortex microcontrollers
- **Computer Vision**: YOLO object detection
- **Hardware Debugging**: Oscilloscopes, logic analyzers
- **Development Tools**: GitLab CI/CD, cross-compilation
